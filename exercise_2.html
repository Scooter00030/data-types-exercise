		/*
		* Exercise Two
		* Why does the following output true?
		*/

		// (Answer) - Because "false" is a string/'real value' so that in turn makes it TRUE. And the first value is a true string for (a && b).

		var a = "false";
		var b = true;

		// "&&" is "and"
		console.log (a && b);

		/*
		* Bonus Question: Why does (b && a) log "false"?
		*/

		// (Answer) - Short circuiting, which logs the first falsy value or last value. The first value is b, which is NOT a 'real value' so it will log back as false.
